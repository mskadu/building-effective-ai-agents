# Building Effective Agents
This repo is a collection of scripts used to illustrate my article series titled - [Building Effective AI Agents with Python: A Practical Guide](https://medium.com/@mskadu/list/building-effective-ai-agents-with-python-a-practical-guide-71a21625b984)

**Note**: Each code module in this repo is illustrative in nature. And while every effort has been made to keep it syntactically accurate, additional work may required for the modules to work with each other.
